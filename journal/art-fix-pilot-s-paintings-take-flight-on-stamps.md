“The paintings used in this set depict airliners of various types and sizes that have served the island of Jersey over the decades - including my favourite, the Trislander.”

“I particularly enjoy painting civil aircraft - especially in the Channel Islands, probably because of those early childhood memories of magical summer holidays and the exciting flights in small and rather noisy planes. It would be fair to say it led to a lifetime interest!

“Seeing my own paintings on the final stamp designs is fantastic - it's satisfying to know all that effort and time has resulted in such a pleasing set of images, it really seems to have worked well in this format.”
